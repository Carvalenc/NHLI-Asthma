***LOOP TRAINING STATA*****
***************************

**Used for repetitive tasks

**Doing the same estimation for different groups

**Instead of using: 

reg price mpg if foreign ==1

**and

reg price mpg if foreign ==0

**A loop could be used

forvalues b = 0/1 {
reg price mpg if foreign==`b'
}

****Another repetitive task that could be performed would
**be the use of a same estimation command for multiple variables, such as:

ttest price, by(foreign)
ttest mpg, by(foreign)
ttest turn, by(foreign)

***A loop could be written saying:

foreach var of varlist {

ttest `var', by(foreign)
}
